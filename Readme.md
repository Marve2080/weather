Here's a simple explanation you can use in your **GitHub README file** for the weather app:

## 🌦️ Simple Weather App (Node.js + Express)

This is a beginner-friendly weather app built using **Node.js**, **Express**, and **EJS**. It tells you the current temperature of any city you search for!

---

## 📁 What Each Part Does (Explained Simply)

```js
import express from "express";
import bodyParser from "body-parser";
import request from "request";
```

* We import the tools we need:

  * **express** → Helps us build the web server.
  * **body-parser** → Helps us read the input from the user.
  * **request** → Helps us talk to the weather API.

---

```js
const app = express();
const port = 3000;
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```

* We create the app and choose port `3000` to run it on.
* Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/).

---

```js
app.use(express.static('public'));
app.set("view engine", "ejs");
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true}));
```

* Serve static files (like CSS) from the `public` folder.
* Use EJS for rendering HTML pages.
* Parse form data so we can read the city name the user types.

---

```js
app.get("/", (req, res) => {
    res.render("index", {weather: null, error: null});
});
```

* When someone visits the homepage (`/`), we show the form with no weather yet.

---

```js
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
    let city = req.body.city;
    let url = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}`;
```

* When the form is submitted, we get the city name.
* We build a URL to ask OpenWeatherMap for the weather in that city.

---

```js
request(url, function(err, response, body){
    if(err){
        res.render('index', {weather: null, error: 'error, try again'});
    }
    else{
        let weather = JSON.parse(body);
        if(weather.main === undefined){
            res.render("index", {weather: null, error: "error, try again"});
        } else {
            let message = `It's ${weather.main.temp} degrees in ${weather.name}!`;
            res.render("index", {weather: message, error: null});
        }
    }
});
```

* We send the request to the weather site.
* If there's an error or bad city, we show an error.
* If successful, we show the weather message on the page.

---

```js
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

* Finally, we start the server and print a message so we know it's working.

## 🧪 How to Run It

1. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install express body-parser request ejs
   ```

2. **Start the app**:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

3. **Visit the app**:
   Open your browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## 🧱 Folder Structure

```
project/
├── app.js
├── views/
│   └── index.ejs
├── public/
│   └── css/
│       └── styles.css
```

## 💡 Tip

Don't forget to use the correct path for your CSS:

```html
<!-- Correct -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/styles.css">
